This was a project I worked on with Rush during my time as Senior Developer at Cole AD. This project came to us after the design team had created a successful rebrand and the client decided to use us to create a brand new website to match.

As Rush was working part-time during the build of this site, I took the lead on the build however the finished product was very much a team effort. With each passing project, we got better at working with each other and it reflected in our results.

The site was designed by one of the designers at Cole AD, Emma Cathie. Initially, a full rebrand for the client formerly known as Refugee Survival Trust, which then rolled into a brand new site with a full design using the new branding.

Once we had the site design, Rush and I divvied up the tasks needed to be completed between ourselves and got to work. Each of us had our own list to complete, but were helping each other out so in the end we both had input and work in all aspects of the site.

This was one of the first sites we undertook together with me as the Senior Developer, so it was a bit of a learning curve for me in making sure that deadlines were being met, keeping up the communication with the rest of the team and client, and delegating tasks where necessary. Looking back, I think I handled this well as the end result was one we are proud of, and there were no major issues on our end to speak of. This has definitely helped me and my skills as a developer going forward.

Multiple custom post types were integrated into the site, for things like projects, reports and case studies. Each of these custom post types have their own custom archive page as well as individual layout, with filters between different categories within. Also added into the site was <a href='https://splidejs.com/' target='_blank'>Splide</a> for use of custom carousels, and <a href='https://www.gravityforms.com/' target='_blank'>Gravity Forms</a> for creating custom forms for contact us and referral applications.
